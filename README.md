# Zenscribe Web App

## Purpose

Sometimes, a customer support agent might need a transcription and summary at a moment's notice. Additionally, they may have questions about a customer's issue that cannot be easily or efficiently answered by reading the summary and transcription. This web app is designed to solve these issues, giving agents a handy tool that can be used when they need it. For more details, please see the original repository [Zenscribe](https://github.com/Nmeng01/Zenscribe).

## Functionality

1. **Transcribe and Summarize Individual Tickets:** Simply provide the ticket id and the call will be transcribed and summarized on the spot.
2. **ChatGPT functionality:** Ask a question about a specific ticket and OpenAI will do its best to provide an answer.
3. More features coming soon...
